Installation
============

**Python 3.8 or higher** is required for installing and using Oblate.

Oblate can be installed using ``pip``::

    python -m pip install oblate

This will install the current stable version of Oblate.

Development version
-------------------

If you want to test the new features of the library, you can install the development version::

    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/izxxr/oblate

**Git** must be installed in order to install the development version.

.. note::

    It is recommended to stick with the stable version for most production projects as the
    development version may contain bugs and might also have breaking changes.

    If you want to install the development version, one way to avoid breaking changes is
    to point the installation to a specific Git commit. Make sure to check the
    `development changelog <https://github.com/izxxr/oblate/blob/main/CHANGELOG.MD>`_ to
    stay aware of any breaking changes.
